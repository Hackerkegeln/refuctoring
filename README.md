# Reverse Refactoring

This repository is for trying out a new session format
I am interested about.

Usually when doing clean code, you try to make the code look better
by using such principles like SOLID, DRY, boy scout rule.

Here I would like to go the other way: help me make the code
look worse!

## Why?

I find it inspiring and funny to look at anti-patterns and sarcastic
tips to improve my clean coding skills. I believe that they
can help you learn more about understanding the joys and necessity of good code quality.

## Rules

Everything that goes is allowed as long as

* you can explain why your change is making the code worse
* as we are still doing refactorings (just the other way round),
  all tests must remain green.
